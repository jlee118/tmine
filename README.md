# tfidfPubMed

## Project package for BCB410 Applied Bioinformatics

This project revolves around a Tf-Idf (Term Frequency, Inverse Document Frequency) package for abstracts of scientific papers taken from PubMed.  This package provides data structures and functions to ease and simplify data transformations surrounding Tf-Idf processes, and provides direct transformations onto PubMed documents.

Please read my project page on the Student Wiki for more instructions on how to use.
